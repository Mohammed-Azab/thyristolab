\section{Load Analysis and Rectifier Performance Study}

\subsection{Objectives}

This section presents a comprehensive analysis of controlled rectifier circuits operating with different load characteristics. The primary objectives of this study are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Simulate half-wave and full-wave controlled rectifiers} using thyristors (SCRs) with varying firing angles to understand phase-controlled rectification behavior
    \item \textbf{Study the effect of different load types} including purely resistive (R), resistive-inductive (RL), and highly inductive loads on current and voltage waveforms
    \item \textbf{Analyze the influence of firing angle} ($\alpha$) on average and RMS output voltage and current across the full control range (0° to 180°)
    \item \textbf{Determine the role of free-wheeling diodes} in improving rectifier performance, particularly for inductive loads
    \item \textbf{Compare the performance} of half-wave, center-tapped full-wave, and bridge full-wave rectifier configurations under various operating conditions
    \item \textbf{Investigate special operating modes} including current continuity for inductive loads and cases of positive load current with negative output voltage
    \item \textbf{Design firing circuits} using pulse generators with adjustable phase delay for thyristor gate control
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{System Specifications}
