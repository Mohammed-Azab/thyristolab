\section{Part II: Load Analysis - Introduction}

\subsection{Objectives}
\TODO{Expand on the following objectives:}

The primary objectives of Part II are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulate and analyze controlled rectifiers under various load conditions
    \item Study the behavior of rectifiers with three load types:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Resistive load (R)
        \item Resistive-inductive load (RL)
        \item Highly inductive load (L >> R)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Investigate current continuity and discontinuity modes
    \item Analyze the role of free-wheeling diodes
    \item Design firing circuits using pulse generators
    \item Compare half-wave and full-wave configurations
    \item Study the phenomenon of negative output voltage with positive current
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Background}
\TODO{Provide background on:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Why load type matters in rectifier operation
    \item Inductive load effects on current waveforms
    \item Applications of controlled rectifiers with different loads:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item DC motor drives (RL load)
        \item Battery charging (EMF load - covered in Part I)
        \item Electrochemical processes
        \item High-power DC supplies
    \end{itemize}
