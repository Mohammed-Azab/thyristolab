\section{Load Analysis (Future Work)}

\textbf{Note:} Part II will be completed in the next phase of the project.

\subsection{Planned Objectives}

Simulate and analyze controlled rectifiers with different load types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resistive load (R)
    \item Resistive-inductive load (RL)
    \item Highly inductive load (L >> R)
    \item Study current continuity modes
    \item Analyze free-wheeling diode effects
    \item Design firing circuits
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expected Findings}

\textbf{Resistive Load:} Current follows voltage, discontinuous at high $\alpha$

\textbf{RL Load:} Current lags voltage, extended conduction, smoother waveform

\textbf{Highly Inductive:} Constant current, continuous conduction, enables regenerative operation
