- Presentation materials (if needed)

## Suggested Documents

### 1. Project Journal
Keep a log of your work:
- Date and time of work sessions
- What was accomplished
- Challenges encountered
- Solutions implemented
- Questions for instructor

### 2. Design Decisions
Document key choices:
- Why certain parameter values were chosen
- Trade-offs considered
- Alternative approaches evaluated
- Justification for selected configurations

### 3. Troubleshooting Log
Track and resolve issues:
- Problem description
- Error messages
- Steps attempted
- Solution that worked
- Lessons learned

### 4. References
Organize your sources:
- Textbook chapters
- Research papers
- Online resources
- MATLAB documentation links
- Helpful examples found

## Tips for Documentation

1. **Document as you go** - Don't wait until the end
2. **Be specific** - Include details, not just "it didn't work"
3. **Include screenshots** - Visual evidence is helpful
4. **Note parameter values** - Record what worked and what didn't
5. **Track time** - Helpful for project management

## File Naming Convention

Use clear, descriptive names:
- `journal_YYYYMMDD.md` - Daily work logs
- `design_decision_battery_params.md` - Specific decisions
- `troubleshooting_simulink_convergence.md` - Problem-solving notes
- `references_controlled_rectifiers.md` - Source materials

## Markdown Format

Use Markdown for easy formatting and version control:
```markdown
# Title

## Section

- Bullet point
- Another point

### Subsection

1. Numbered item
2. Another item

**Bold text** for emphasis
*Italic text* for terms

`code` or command references
```

## Integration with Report

Some documentation here may be useful for:
- Explaining methodology in report
- Discussing challenges in report
- Providing context for design choices
- Supporting conclusions with evidence

## Privacy Note

Do not commit:
- Personal contact information
- Sensitive university credentials
- Copyrighted material (unless properly cited)
- Any information violating academic integrity policies

## Good Luck!

Thorough documentation will make report writing much easier and demonstrates professional engineering practice.
